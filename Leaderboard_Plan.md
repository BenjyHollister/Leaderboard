# Leaderboard Project Plan
## Overview
The aim of this project is to build a Python-based leaderboard app to keep track of scores amongst players of a sports team. Starting from a terminal app, to a basic GUI, to a polished app or webapp. The data for this project will be stored in MySQL.

## Planned Features

## Project Structure
I am going to break this project down into manageable steps, where I implement the idea across different types of output. This will help show how it can be implemented differently and gives frequent milestones for testing and project evaluation. Furthermore, creating the program iteratively allows creation of a working pipeline, and expansion of features upon that. The three different systems are as follows:

**1.** Terminal Program - single leaderboard with basic functions outputted in the terminal of VSCode

**2.** GUI Program - single leaderboard with same functions, presented in a simple GUI using Tkinter

**3.** Pycharm App - multiple leaderboard with same functions and some, presented in a fully working GUI, using the Pycharm IDE
