# Leaderboard Project Plan
## Overview
The aim of this project is to build a Python-based leaderboard app to keep track of scores amongst players of a sports team. Starting from a terminal app, to a basic GUI, to a polished app or webapp. The data for this project will be stored in MySQL.

## Planned Features
* Add player
* Add score
* Delete player
* Show leaderboard
* View several different leaderboards at the click of a button
* Help window on main menu


## Project Structure
I am going to break this project down into manageable steps, where I implement the idea across different types of output. This will help show how it can be implemented differently and gives frequent milestones for testing and project evaluation. Furthermore, creating the program iteratively allows creation of a working pipeline, and expansion of features upon that. The three different systems are as follows:

**1.** Terminal Program - single leaderboard with basic functions outputted in the terminal of VSCode

**2.** GUI Program - single leaderboard with same functions, presented in a simple GUI using Tkinter

**3.** Pycharm App - multiple leaderboard with same functions and some, presented in a fully working GUI, using the Pycharm IDE

### Terminal Program
* This is going to be a very basic concept of the final version just to have a deliverable idea of what I want
* It will run in my VSCode terminal and have the features: add score/player, delete player, show leaderboard.
* It won't have multiple leaderboards
* It won't have a help window

### GUI Program
* This is going to be still a basic concept of the final version
* The purpose of this version is to include a GUI and try to add a couple more features
* Presented using tkinter to have a simple GUI
* I'm not trying to make it look nice front end at this level, but I will for the web app version
* It will have the features: add score/player, delete player, show leaderboard, help window.
* It won't have multiple leaderboard, that will be implemented in the webapp
  

### Web App
* This is going to be the final version of the project
* This is the version that I will make available and usable for people, so it will be the most finished version
* It will have the features: add score/player, delete player, show leaderboard, help window, switch between leaderboards
  

## Future Features
* The following are potential features that could be added to the final project, but it is not the base case for a successful project:
    * Player profiles
        * Includes their ranks on leaderboards and their scores
     * Record of previous scores shown, not only the highest score recorded
     * 

## Demo Strategy
* The demo's will be taken when the version is ready and posted on the readME.
* The demo's will show the basic features and how the program works.
* They are presenet to show how I've presented each program and to show that at the finished product of each program that they work.
