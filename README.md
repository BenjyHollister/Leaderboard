# Leaderboard Program

## Introduction
This project is a python-based application designed to manage and display the scores of players. This is an easy way to track the performance and visualise rankings in real time. Built through different iterations, getting more complicated as time goes by, from terminal output, to basic GUI, to webapp. The end goal with this project is to make it universal, that it is not just specific to my team and my purpose, but that it can be easily altered to the user's needs. 

## Features
* View leaderboards
* Add, update, and remove player scores
* Automatically sort rankings in real time
* Simple and readable code structure
## Demo Videos

## Future Improvements
* Make it universally usable to fit any users' needs
* Automatically upload the data into the leaderboard
